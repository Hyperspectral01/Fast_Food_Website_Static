# Fast Food Website Project

This project aims to provide a smooth interface for users to access menu items and other vital information on a fast food website. The goal is to create a convincing platform that encourages users to buy and eat from the website.

**Platform Overview:**

McDonalds Online provides users with a robust digital platform to access a comprehensive selection of burger recipes. Developed with a focus on user experience and functionality, this platform serves as a gateway to the McDonalds brand in the digital space.

**Menu Integration and Delivery Links:**

The platform seamlessly integrates a diverse range of burger recipes, each accompanied by detailed specifications and preparation instructions. Additionally, direct integration with third-party services such as Zomato and Swiggy enables users to place orders for their chosen recipes directly from the platform.

**Quality Assurance Protocol:**

A key aspect of the platform is its adherence to strict quality assurance protocols throughout the recipe selection and preparation stages. Ingredients are meticulously sourced, and recipes are rigorously tested to uphold the McDonalds brand's reputation for freshness and taste consistency.

## Features

1. **Availability of a Dark Mode**
2. **HTML Title and Favicon:** The HTML <title> tag is set to "McDonaldâ€™s", providing the title for the webpage. A shortcut icon (favicon) is linked to the webpage using the McDonald's logo.
3. **External Libraries and Fonts:** Various external libraries and fonts are linked to the webpage, including Google Fonts, Font Awesome, and Remix Icon.
4. **Swiper CSS & JS:** Swiper CSS and JS files are included to enable the integration of Swiper, a popular touch-enabled slider library.
5. **Scroll Reveal:** The Scroll Reveal library is included to animate elements as they come into view during scrolling.
6. **JavaScript Code:** JavaScript code is provided to implement various functionalities on the webpage, including scroll animations, navigation menu toggling, menu bar functionality, dark mode toggle, scroll-to-top button, and scroll header styling.
7. **Express Server Setup:** The Express framework is used to set up a server for handling HTTP requests.
8. **MongoDB Integration:** The Mongoose library is used to establish a connection with a MongoDB database.
9. **Routing and Redirects:** Express routes are defined to handle different HTTP requests, such as GET and POST requests.
10. **Server Listening:** The Express server is configured to listen on a specific port (defaulting to port 5000).
11. **Responsive Web Design:** Various responsive design techniques are implemented to ensure optimal viewing experience across devices.

## Description

### Frontend

**Technologies used:** HTML, CSS, Tailwind (Customized), Remix Icons, Google Fonts, Font Awesome, Scroll Reveal.

The Main Page consists of Home Page, Footer and various sections like Home, Menu, Order Online, Review, and Contacts. These sections can be accessed from the navigation, and Swiper JS is used in many places for enhanced user experience. Transitions and visual effects have been added to improve user engagement.

### Backend

**Technologies and packages Used:** Node.js, JavaScript, Express JS, Mongoose, Nodemon, Body-Parser.

An internal server has been set up using Express.js, and routing has been established to handle data exchange between different pages. Validation of data is performed on the backend. Backend scripts handle functionalities such as user authentication and enabling/disabling various features.

## Future Scope

Various enhancements can be incorporated into the project, including:

- Integrating a web page to order food (including scaling and secure payment gateways).
- Integrating review tools.
- Implementing a better frontend using frameworks like React.
- Integrating an email authentication system during sign-up.
- Implementing a timeout for security reasons on the login page.
- Enhancing password security.
- Including a careers page on the main website.
- Hosting the website for public use using a good domain name.

## Challenges Faced

- Establishing backend connections and routing.
- Implementing complex transitions and visual effects.
- Implementing dark mode.
- Utilizing Swiper.js for unique user review display.
